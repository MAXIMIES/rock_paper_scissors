# rock_paper_scissors

This project is an assignment from The Odin Project's course.
It is an Rock Paper Scissors-game that is meant to be played
for five rounds. The code will be ran in the browser. Outcome 
and score are to be logged into the console, viewable from the
Dev-tools.

I tried to implement the lessons from the Problem Solving
lessons. I wrote two pseudocodes down, on paper, for the
getComputerChoice() and playRound() functions. I found this
surprisingly helpfull, without the lesson i would have just 
started to hack away at the code immediately.

I console logged most times variables got new values to be 
on the safe side. I also console logged what the functions
recieved as arguments to make sure nothing got fed the wrong
values. This too came in helpful.

At the moment the project is missing a condition for retrying 
a round if the players input is not matching one of the three
required.
